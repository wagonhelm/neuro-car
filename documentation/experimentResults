Justin with eyes open/closed, sampled from ~30s
  eval=10, train=68
  0% accuracy with C=10, gamma=0.125

Micah with eyes open/closed, sampled from ~2min
  eval=124, train=491
  0.959677% accuracy with C=10, gamma=0.01

Temporal aggregation affects accuracy quite negatively.
This is probably due to inconsistent wave forms and noise summing.
gradLength = 5, accuracy ~ 65%
gradLength = 2, accuracy ~80%

Transition / quick clips do not work. There is not enough time for the EEG signal to gravitate towards the new state.
Further, the transitions contain both traits of the original and target states, hence which dataset to attribute them to
is unclear. Testing both ways leads to poor accuracy. Training them as separate classes also reduces accuracy of the non-transition
states. This is probably due to the transition classes ruining the ability of hyperplanes to separate the non-transition points.

Final models:

eyes: gamma=0.01, C=5, 0.890% ?
fatigue: gamma=0.0001, C=5, 0.813% ?
focus: gamma=0.01, C=5, 0.885% ?

Alpha isolation:

alpha=1-11Hz
TP9 = channel0 (left ear)
AF7 = channel1 (left forehead)
AF8 = channel2 (right forehead)
TP10 = channel3 (right ear)

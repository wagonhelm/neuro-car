ThunderSVM: A Fast SVM Library on GPUs and CPUs
======================================
The mission of ThunderSVM is to help users easily and efficiently apply SVMs to solve problems. ThunderSVM exploits GPUs and multi-core CPUs to achieve high efficiency. Key features of ThunderSVM are as follows.
* Support all functionalities of LibSVM such as one-class SVMs, SVC, SVR and probabilistic SVMs.
* Use same command line options as LibSVM.
* Support Python, R and Matlab interfaces.
* Supported Operating Systems: Linux, Windows and MacOS.

**Why accelerate SVMs**: A [survey](https://www.kaggle.com/amberthomas/kaggle-2017-survey-results) conducted by Kaggle in 2017 shows that 26% of the data mining and machine learning practitioners are users of SVMs.

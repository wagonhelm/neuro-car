## What's new
- We have recently released [ThunderGBM](https://github.com/Xtra-Computing/thundergbm), a fast GBDT and Random Forest library on GPUs.
- add scikit-learn interface, see [here](https://github.com/Xtra-Computing/thundersvm/tree/master/python)
## Overview
The mission of ThunderSVM is to help users easily and efficiently apply SVMs to solve problems. ThunderSVM exploits GPUs and multi-core CPUs to achieve high efficiency. Key features of ThunderSVM are as follows.
* Support all functionalities of LibSVM such as one-class SVMs, SVC, SVR and probabilistic SVMs.
* Use same command line options as LibSVM.
* Support [Python](python/), [R](R/), [Matlab](Matlab/) and [Ruby](https://github.com/ankane/thundersvm) interfaces.
* Supported Operating Systems: Linux, Windows and MacOS.

**Why accelerate SVMs**: A [survey](https://www.kaggle.com/amberthomas/kaggle-2017-survey-results) conducted by Kaggle in 2017 shows that 26% of the data mining and machine learning practitioners are users of SVMs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* cmake 2.8 or above
* gcc 4.8 or above for Linux and MacOS
* Visual C++ for Windows

If you want to use GPUs, you also need to install CUDA.

* [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) 7.5 or above

### Quick Install
Download the Python wheel file (For Python3 or above).

* For Linux

    * `pip install thundersvm` for CUDA 9.0 - linux_x86_64

    * [CPU - linux_x86_64](https://github.com/Xtra-Computing/thundersvm/blob/d38af58e0ceb7e5d948f3ef7d2c241ba50133ee6/python/dist/thundersvm-cpu-0.2.0-py3-none-linux_x86_64.whl)

* For Windows (64bit)

    * [CUDA 10.0 - win64](https://github.com/Xtra-Computing/thundersvm/blob/d38af58e0ceb7e5d948f3ef7d2c241ba50133ee6/python/dist/thundersvm-cu10-0.2.0-py3-none-win_amd64.whl)

    * [CPU - win64](https://github.com/Xtra-Computing/thundersvm/blob/d38af58e0ceb7e5d948f3ef7d2c241ba50133ee6/python/dist/thundersvm-cpu-0.2.0-py3-none-win_amd64.whl)

Install the Python wheel file.
```bash
pip install thundersvm-cu90-0.2.0-py3-none-linux_x86_64.whl
```
##### Example
```python
from thundersvm import SVC
clf = SVC()
clf.fit(x, y)
```
### Download
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Xtra-Computing/thundersvm.git
```
### Build on Linux (build [instructions](docs/get-started.md#installation-for-macos) for MacOS and Windows)
##### ThunderSVM on GPUs
```bash
cd thundersvm
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make -j
```

If you run into issues that can be traced back to your version of gcc, use `cmake` with a version flag to force gcc 6. That would look like this:

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc-6 -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-6 ..
```


##### ThunderSVM on CPUs
```bash
# in thundersvm root directory
git submodule init eigen && git submodule update
mkdir build && cd build && cmake -DUSE_CUDA=OFF -DUSE_EIGEN=ON .. && make -j
```
If ```make -j``` doesn't work, please simply use ```make```. The number of CPU cores to use can be specified by the ```-o``` option (e.g., ```-o 10```), and refer to [Parameters](docs/parameters.md) for more information.

### Quick Start
```bash
./bin/thundersvm-train -c 100 -g 0.5 ../dataset/test_dataset.txt
./bin/thundersvm-predict ../dataset/test_dataset.txt test_dataset.txt.model test_dataset.predict
```
You will see `Accuracy = 0.98` after successful running.

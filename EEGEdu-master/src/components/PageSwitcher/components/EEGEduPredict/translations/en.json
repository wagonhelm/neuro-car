    "In the next module we will train and test classifiers of brain data like we have been looking at so far. ",
    "We will collect data in two different conditions, with the goal of inducing two different brain states. ",
    "We will then train a classifier based on the pattern of activity over time, frequency, and space on the head. ",
    "We will then use the classifier to predict on real time which of the two brain states are currently happening. ",
    "That is, we will attempt to predict if peoples brain activity more closely resembles condition A or conditoin B ",
    "Of the training data. "

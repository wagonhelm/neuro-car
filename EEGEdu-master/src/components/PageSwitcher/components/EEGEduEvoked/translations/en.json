  	"The electrical activity evoked by individual presentations of stimuli does create small changes in electrical voltage. ", 
  	"These changes are, however, very small, about 1-10 microVolts (\u03BCV), and the noise from other things like eye movements and muscles is sometimes 10x as large. ",
  	"This noise can be mitigated by averaging this evoked activity over repeated presentations of the same stimulus. ",
  	"This average voltage in response to a stimulus is called an Event-related potential (ERP) or evoked potential (EP). ",
